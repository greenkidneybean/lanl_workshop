hxb2 is the primary reference?

build a tree with references and test

database began 1986
can use for any virus (tools)

use wildcard "*" in search to show everything

context: geographic and phylogenic

outgroup: next closest croup outside your search
clades: a, b, c
  others are a combination (BF1 is a combination of
  b and f, and the 1 is just in this donor)

pipeline:
alignment->tree->refine alignment

maximum liklihood
generate an alignment and pop it into this or pup fig


figtree
before importing tree, treat gap handling "treat as missing"
tree -> midpoint root

genecutter:
virus is often not intact, single insertion or deletion
deals with shitty overlapping reading frames

save info to background -> tab delimited database

prebuilt alignments

alignment type: use filtered web (good sequences)
compendium alignment - overall picture, fit on 2 pages
  pic of global epidemic (200 seq)

consensus: it's like the common ancestor
  doesn't change much
  anchor for the clade

what if you just improve the replicase of the virus

elimdupes - condense deep sequencing reads to a matrix of only unique reads and the count

make tree to double-check expectations
  where do the samples lie
  check against a reference

sequence locator (tool)
awesome, give the position of each gene in your sequence

variable region characteristics (tools)
strong relationship between hypervariale loops and viral escape
have strong charges

highlighter (tool)
id recombinants
strip away what is the same
ctl epitope?




questions:
whats the backend database (sql?)
